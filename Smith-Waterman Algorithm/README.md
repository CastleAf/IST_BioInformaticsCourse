# Smith-waterman Algorithm
Work not finished yet, need to cover cases where prevCell comes from 2 ways (and not only from an upper gap, a diagonal score or a bottom gap) or even 3 ways (all of them at the same time). Need to fix it so I can find all the possible alignments.

A good website to verify the results:
