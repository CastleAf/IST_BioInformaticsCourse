**Afonso Castelão, ist190700, MEIC-A**

This Repository contains some of my report deliveries from a Bioinformatics course from my Masters Degree in Information Systems and Computer Engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico.

You'll find programs of my three lab reports:
* **Report 1:** Smith-Waterman Algorithm for pairwise sequence alignment
* **Report 2:** HMM Algorithms for a specific HMM Model

All the programs are written in python. All work in this repository was done at the Fall Semester of 2020/2021.
