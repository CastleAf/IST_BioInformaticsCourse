# IST BioInformatics Course

**Afonso Castelão, ist190700, MEIC-A**

This Repository contains two of my report deliveries from a Bioinformatics course from my Masters Degree in Information Systems and Computer Engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico.

You'll find programs of my two lab program reports:
* **[Report 1:](https://github.com/CastleAf/IST_BioInformaticsCourse/tree/master/Smith-Waterman%20Algorithm)** Smith-Waterman Algorithm for pairwise sequence alignment
* **[Report 2:](https://github.com/CastleAf/IST_BioInformaticsCourse/tree/master/HMM_Algorithms)** HMM Algorithms for a specific HMM Model

All the programs are written in python. All work in this repository was done at the Fall Semester of 2020/2021.
